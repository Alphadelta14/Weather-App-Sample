Weather-App-Sample
==================

To run the python backend, run ./start.sh as a normal user. This serves up
an index file as well as any external resources by visiting
http://localhost:12080/

There are two main urls which contain JSON data, /day and /week.

Your task is to create a Backbone oriented project. This project must use
a single page. The default view of this page is to show a weekly forecast.
When a day of the week is pressed, the user should be shown a daily forecast
of that day. There should be an option to refresh the weekly forecast.
Backbone's Models, Views, and Collections should be extended and used
appropriately.

Please place all scripts into a directory called static/scripts and all
stylesheets into a static/styles directory.
